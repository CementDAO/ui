Client and other frontend/ui

## Installation

Please, install all the dependencies using yarn.

```bash
$ yarn
```

To run a local testnet as shown below, make sure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) (without [need of sudo](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)) on your machine.

## Usage

As a frontend developer that does not work with blockchain, you have the option to run a local testnet and deploy contract using only one command
```bash
$ npm run deploy-network
```
But for this to work, make sure you have the folder structure as shown bellow and have all dependecies installed in **ui** repository and **Contracts** repository.

Folder structure:
 * some folder
   * ui
   * Contracts
